# SQL Challenge

In this challenge, data analysis is performed using PostgreSQL (pgAdmin 4) on historical (1980s-1990s) employee data for a fictitious tech firm. Data are divided into six CSV files (included in repo). Using the attached Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) as a guide, the data are imported to tables created in SQL with primary keys and foreign keys assigned to connect the tables. The data are analyzed using SQL functions such as SELECT, JOIN, COUNT, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY to answer given questions about employees.
